- Built factory functions with conditional type creation
- Demonstrated string literal types for controlled vocabularies

**Key Concepts**: Behavioral interfaces, type predicates (`is` keyword), union types, string literal types

### Task 3: Ambient Namespaces
**External Library Integration**
- Created ambient declaration files (`.d.ts`) for JavaScript libraries
- Used triple slash directives for dependency management
- Demonstrated safe integration of untyped JavaScript code
- Built type bridges for existing codebases

**Key Concepts**: Ambient declarations, `.d.ts` files, triple slash directives, type bridging

### Task 4: Namespace Architecture
**Educational Platform with Declaration Merging**
- Organized code using TypeScript namespaces
- Implemented declaration merging across multiple files
- Created modular, extensible architecture
- Demonstrated subject-specific teacher qualifications

**Key Concepts**: Namespace organization, declaration merging, modular architecture

### Task 5: Brand Convention & Nominal Typing
**University Credit System**
- Implemented branded types for identical but conceptually different data
- Created compile-time type safety for business logic
- Prevented logical errors through sophisticated type design
- Demonstrated nominal typing in a structural type system

**Key Concepts**: Branded types, nominal typing, compile-time safety, domain-specific types
